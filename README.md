Connect-R

This is my Minimax-powered connect R game. 
It does successfully implement the minimax algorithm, albeit it does need some improvement to its heuristic.
The main issue that I have with it is that while it does account for the value of the opposing players tokens, 
it does not value blocking the other player enough, as you can see in the video I will attatch. I might be able
to improve this if I make a new way to check the board taking this into account differently for the oppising
player. However it does make some rational decisions about where to place, when it shouldn't be blocking me.
